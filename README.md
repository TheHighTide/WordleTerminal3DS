# Wordle Terminal 3DS
### What is it?
Wordle Terminal 3DS is a basic bare-bones port of Wordle for the 3DS.

For those of you who don't know, _"Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by the Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle. In the game, players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, receiving feedback through colored tiles that indicate correct letters and their placement. A single puzzle is released daily, with all players attempting to solve the same word. It was inspired by word games like Jotto and the game show Lingo."_ - Wikipedia

### How many words are available?
So far, after lots of searching and formatting, there are 3099 words available for you to guess in Wordle Terminal 3DS!

### How is the gameplay?
In Wordle Terminal 3DS, the gameplay is almost exactly the same as the original Wordle albeit with a controller instead of touchscreen or mouse. You press _START_ to reset the game, and _A_ to make a guess. Its as simple as that!
